**GUESS THE NUMBER**

The game written in C# is a number guessing console game in which we have to guess a number randomly selected by the computer. The user gets a limited number of attempts. If you run out of attempts, you will lose. With each answer, the game gives you a hint about whether your answer is less or more than the number guessed by the computer or not
